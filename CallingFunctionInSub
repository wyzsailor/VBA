'Function in VBA pretty much like how it is done in C++ , There is a local scope stuff you also need to be aware of 
'First let me write something about accessing cell's value in VBA in Excel 

'You can access this way ,Set SheetOne as WorkSheets object ,and make this object link with a specific exsiting sheet 
'You know how to do it ,don't you ? 
'This will return specific value even if you are in a function 
SheetOne.Cells(RowsNo,ColumnsNo).Value  'using Cells Object  . 

'or this way will work either 

SheetOne.Range("A1").Value  ' using Range object .

'Call a function in Sub 

Sub Subname()
Call functionname(para) 
End Sub 

Function functionname(para)  ' Public if this function is not within the same source code as the calling sub 
'Local variable can be created here .
End Function 

'If you wanna operate on a specific sheet , you need to passing the sheet object to the function as well 
'see the following example . 
Call FindMatchingValue(500, SheetOne)


End Sub
 Function FindMatchingValue(intValueToFind As Integer, SheetOne As Worksheet)
       MsgBox SheetOne.Range("A1").Value 'if you wanna use SheetOne , you must pass it into this function 
End Function
